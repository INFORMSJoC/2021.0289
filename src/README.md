Python code for algorithms based on regular FD estimator and multilevel FD estimator.

'FD estimator.py' contains algorithm in Section 3, that uses approximating systems to construct finite difference estimators.

'Multilevel FD estimator.py' contains algorithm in Section 4, that uses approximating systems to construct multilevel finite difference estimators.

'generate_optimal.py' contains the parameter generation (mean return and covariance matrix) for the portfolio selection experiment in Section 5, as well as the calculation of close-form optimal solution under given parameters.
