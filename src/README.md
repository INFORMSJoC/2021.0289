This is the Python code for algorithms based on regular FD estimator and multilevel FD estimator.

'FD estimator.py' contains algorithm in Section 3, that uses approximating systems to construct finite difference estimators.

'Multilevel FD estimator.py' contains algorithm in Section 4, that uses approximating systems to construct multilevel finite difference estimators.
